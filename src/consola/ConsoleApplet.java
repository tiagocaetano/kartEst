/*  The ConsoleApplet provides a basis for writing applets that simulate
    line-oriented console-type input/output.  The class ConsoleCanvas is
    used to provide the I/O routines; these routines type output into
    the ConsoleCanvas and read input typed there by the user.  See the
    files CanvasPanel.java and ConsoleCanvas.java for information.
    
    A console applet is set up to run one particular program.  The applet
    includes a button that the user presses to run the program (or to
    abort it when it is running).  It also includes a label, which by default
    is "Java I/O Console".  The default program, defined in this file,
    is a simple Hello World program.
    
    To write a new console applet, with a more interesting program, you
    should create a subclass of ConsoleApplet.  The subclass should
    override the method  program() , which represents the program to 
    be run.  The program should use the instance variable, console, to
    do input/output.  For example, console.putln("HelloWorld.")
    or N=console.getInt().  All the public methods of class ConsolePanel
    can be called in the program.
    
    (Of course, you could also just modify this file, instead of
    writing a subclass.)

    July 17, 1998: Program was modified to be compliant with Java 1.1.
    December 9, 1997:  This is a modification of a version written
    on August 2, 1996.  (Subclasses of previous versions of the old applet
    should still work with this new version.)
